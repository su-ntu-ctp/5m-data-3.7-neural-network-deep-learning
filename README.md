## Lesson Objectives

At the end of the lesson, learners shall be able to:

- **Describe Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** as the foundation of Neural Networks, explaining their architectural progression from single-layer linear classifiers to multi-layer systems capable of solving non-linear problems through activation functions and backpropagation.

- **Create and train a perceptron using NumPy** from scratch, coding the mathematical formulation of forward passes and weight updates to understand the core mechanics of neural learning without relying on high-level frameworks.

- **Build and train a Fully Connected Neural Network (MLP) using PyTorch**, leveraging the framework to construct a deep learning model, define loss functions and optimizers, and execute the training loop for classification tasks on datasets like MNIST.
